        <br>
  <p id="102"> Web development refers in general to the tasks associated with developing websites for hosting via
    intranet or internet. The web development process includes web design, web content development,
    client-side/server-side scripting and network security configuration, among other tasks</p>
  <p> In a broader sense, web development encompasses all the actions, updates, and operations required to build,
    maintain and manage a website to ensure its performance, user experience, and speed are optimal.</p>
  <p>It might also, but not necessarily, include all those strategic actions needed to ensure its proper ranking on
    search engine results. Usually, those tasks pertain to a different specialization, namely search engine optimization
    (SEO)</p>

    <p id="104">Graphic design is a craft where professionals create visual content to communicate messages. By applying
      visual hierarchy and page layout techniques, designers use typography and pictures to meet users’ specific needs
      and focus on the logic of displaying elements in interactive designs, to optimize the user experience.</p>
    <p>
      Graphic design is an ancient craft, dating back past Egyptian hieroglyphs to at least 17,000-year-old cave
      paintings. It’s a term that originated in the 1920s’ print industry. It continues to cover a range of activities
      including logo creation. Graphic design in this sense concerns aesthetic appeal and marketing. Graphic designers
      attract viewers using images, color and typography. However, graphic designers working in user experience (UX)
      design must justify stylistic choices regarding, say, image locations and font with a human-centered approach.
      That means you need to focus on—and seek to empathize the most with—your specific users while you create
      good-looking designs that maximize usability. Aesthetics must serve a purpose—in UX design we don’t create art for
      art’s sake. So, graphic designers must branch into visual design.</p>
